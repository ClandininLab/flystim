1. lcr_set to keep only blue LED on the lightcrafter and adjust power level
2. GL_env_set to reduce input lag (hopefully) by turning off VSYNC and reducing GPU prerendered frames.


I've also turned off "full composition pipeline" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Might need to use:
nvidia-settings --load-config-only --assign="SyncToVBlank=0"


 __GL_MaxFramesAllowed=1 __GL_YIELD="NOTHING" __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=0
