# Introduction

**flystim** is a software package for generating visual stimuli for fruit fly experiments.  The stimuli are perspective-corrected and can be displayed across multiple screens.  Sample code, illustrating various use cases, is included in the **examples** directory.

# Installation

First open a terminal and navigate to a convenient directory.  Then download and install the latest **flystim** codebase:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/ClandininLab/flystim.git
> cd flystim
> pip3 install -e .
```

This should install the Python package dependencies if you don't already have them.

# Running the Example Code

In a terminal tab, navigate to the examples directory and run one of the sample programs, such as **show_all.py**.

```shell
> cd flystim/examples
> python3 show_all.py
```

Each example can be exited at any time by pressing Ctrl+C.
